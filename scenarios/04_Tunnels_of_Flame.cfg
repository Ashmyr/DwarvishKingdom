We've passed the furthest claims of our Kingdom at this point. The trek through the Feral Tunnels was eventful and dangerous, though nothing out of the ordinary for frontier tunnels.

Now we are in the Caverns of Flame. The heat is almost unbearable. I'm used to the lower tunnels and their colder drafts, not this beating heat. I would prefer going another, quicker way, but Arolmar has made it clear there is no longer another way, with the destroyed rail and all...

Despite all of that, I'm partially glad to have taken this route. I've never seen magma with my own two eyes. It's such a marvelous sight; nothing like I'd imagined. I still find it hard to believe that some Dwarves <i> want </i> to live close to it, though. It is remarkably beautiful, yet so dangerous..."

Arolmar insists on having the Troll in our company, despite my protests. I'm honestly unsure how to feel about it. On one hand, we're on a journey to liberate a city from its kind.

On another hand, it seems harmless, and there's only one of it. It's begun to tell Arolmar of its people, the "Darites". It's told stories which have even caught my interest at times -- some involving trade with Drakes, Humans and even Elves. Often, these stories seem far too fantastical to be true, but I doubt a young troll would have the ability to simply conjure up such intricate stories.

...perhaps there are developed Troll civilizations out there? With how many there are, it is not unlikely, I suppose, but I am unsure..."

            message= _ "I remember there being some sort of semi-primitive Drake civilization down here. They must be what's ahead. Scouts used to visit this far out, and I remember some of their reports. The Drakes they encountered were typically quite peaceful and welcome to trade and negotiations, but very strict about honor and respect. The Scouts also mentioned they maintained a proud marble temple, which they used to praise their Gods. The Temple was quite a sight, I remember almost every scout talking about how it was like a perfectly carved-hole from the sky, reaching all the way down to these caverns. However, to my disappointment, the reports stopped two decades ago due to stretched trade routes. It was a shame, but I believe we may be able to restore contact and relations now. I have no doubt the Trolls they face are raiders. Let us side with these Drakes."
