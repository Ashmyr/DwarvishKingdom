The march these past few days has left me with much time to think. I find myself wondering about the state of our Kingdom, about all the clans we have lost contact with, and how the other Dwarven Kingdoms can or do not communicate with us. The only ones left are a smattering of smaller clans between here and Wesnoth. Despite the long, arduous trek to Knalga, its loss hit me the hardest. It was always a bulwark against all odds in the past, so its loss is an ill omen for the state of my people. We've tried to send help for nearly a decade, but orcs have infested the valleys outside their tunnels.

It was not long after we became so isolated that the Trolls began their campaign of terror, engaging in guerilla warfare inside the eastern mines and slowly making their way closer. For ten years, we've battled a losing war that has drained both our money and our ability to mine resources...

Now, of all places, Marne has fallen to Trolls now. I will not allow this news to become simply another event I have heard about. I will drive them from my city, even if I must join my ancestors in the afterlife to ensure it is done. May Gegran guide and protect me until my mission is complete."

Humans in our sacred burial grounds, how dare they! The tombs of our Ancestors, the ancient Heroes of Dwarfdom, who rose from the dark and carried the foundations of our empire on their backs... They treated their memory as if it was worthless, their tombs nothing more than a treasure trove to be plundered. The fury I felt at their trespass, it was like nothing I had ever felt before, powerful, all consuming. I was unaware that I was capable of such hatred, and the thought of it scares me... 

After we defeated the bandits, an old dwarf by the name of Semas joined us. Though he is old, even by our own standards, he still is capable of putting up an impressive, if a little unhinged, fight."
