We are through the Caverns of Flame. It was not an easy journey. The Trolls were tougher than I expected, and the Drakes didn't seem entirely ready for a full-scale assault. I suppose we aren't the only ones to underestimate those beasts.

Furthermore, the trek was rather interesting. I had never seen a Drake before. They are such tall creatures; more than double the height of most of my men! When a human mage visited several years ago, he talked to us about giants, ogres, all sorts of beasts. Yet, even in my wildest imagination, I couldn't imagine one more fierce than the Drakes I saw.

They're majestic in their prowess and truly fearsome. In the fight, they were truly awe-inspiring and remarkable. I will remember this battle as a heroic, fierce tale to ring down to our children... mine especially... presuming they have... survived...

...Regardless of how I try to distract my mind, I keep worrying if they are safe...I'm hurrying as fast as our Expedition will allow, but every day I fear I'll arrive even just a minute too late...the fear is nothing like what I've felt before. I keep questioning how long I'd spent in the Castle, if only I'd managed to visit before this attack, could I have somehow changed what happened?

We're coming up on the land of the Trolls. Arolmar has told me his knowledge of these lands is lacking at best. I have one hand on my axe, another on my quill at all times. Those beasts will not stop me from getting to my home."

We managed to save Ka'reius, leader of the Drakes. It wasn't an easy task. From what we could tell, the Blackrocks were raiding them for <i> months </i>, and we had just dealt a major blow to the raiders. Ka'reius welcomed us into his land, boasting of our feats to his people. We were treated as esteemed guests and given fine Drake cuisine. It was more sweet than I had liked; I'm not accustomed to the food of the surface-world, though I appreciated the gesture. I could tell Dwarvish was difficult for many of these Drakes, but they must've contacted other Dwarvish nations before, because some were almost as fluent as the most fluent Humans can be.

He showed us his temple, something he was beyond proud of. It was a marvelous sight to behold. The stone was finely carved, with intricate depictions all over the white marble of all sorts of tall tales from Drake history. Ka'reius was addressed with a word in his language that I couldn't entirely understand, and I'm not sure if I completely understand the cultural implications of. It meant something similar to Arolmar's rank, 'Burginar', or roughly, 'Great Sage'... I think. I cannot be sure.

We rested for a day longer than I had hoped. When we ventured out, the Drake who was assigned to our company boasted about his training. He told us how grateful he was for saving his kind, and the honor of serving beside "such fine warriors". He led us down a marble path to the edge of his territory, and told us he was ready for whatever laid ahead."

I've honestly been warming up to the presence of the Troll. He's begun to learn quite a lot about my kind; picking up on native Dwarvish words, symbols, and surprisingly, cartography. He learns faster at those subjects than some of my recruits and his expertise is undeniable. We had a brief conversation the other day, just between me and him. He asked me questions about my homeland, which I answered with some hesitation, but some excitement. There were so few times in the Castle where I got to tell people the stories of my youth. So many of my colleagues there were so busy; 'no time for idle chatter'...

Thinking back on it now, it is something that I never imagined I'd do. It's curious, how experiences can change perspectives..."
