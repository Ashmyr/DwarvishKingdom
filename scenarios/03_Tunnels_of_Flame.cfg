We have ventured beyond even the farthest reaches of Garhme's borders now. The trek through the Feral Tunnels was eventful and dangerous, though nothing <i> completely </i> unheard of for frontier tunnels.

We are travelling through the Caverns of Flame. I am not used to the unyielding heat in these tunnels. I must step away every so often, lest I ruin these pages with my sweat. Arolmar has assured me that the rail has been destroyed, leaving no faster alternative route for our journey. Though every day is hell here, I cannot say that the sight of magma does not fascinate me. Truly the lifeblood of the mountain is a beautiful sight, though I cannot comprehend why Dwarves insist on living so close to it, risking the dangers and withstanding the heat from it."

Arolmar insists on allowing the Troll in our company, despite my many protests. It may seem harmless, but I cannot forget our mission to liberate a city from its kind.

It's begun to tell Arolmar of its people, a tribe or group called the 'Darites'. Some of the stories it has told have caught my interest, as they involve tales of trade with Drakes, Humans, and even Elves, though it seems far-fetched to me. I don't claim to know much about Trolls' minds, but I doubt such a young Troll could simply fabricate such intricate stories.

Perhaps Arolmar's idea that some Troll settlements have developed to such an extent in the area have some legitimacy to them. Even if they do not exist in these tunnels, I don't doubt that somewhere such a civilization exists... as much as I do not wish to believe such a leap is possible for a barbaric race such as the Trolls."
