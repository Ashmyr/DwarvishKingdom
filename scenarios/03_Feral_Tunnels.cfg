Over these past few days, I have found myself reflecting on the state of our Kingdom. The state is almost abysmal. We have lost contact with numerous other nations, although the loss of contact with Knalga hit me the hardest. The trek there was always arduous at the best of times, but a complete loss of contact is wholly unexpected, and for almost a full decade! Every time we send a caravan to make contact, they report the same thing; the swarms of Orcs!

And then, after that, Gegran forbid, the Eastern Mines were overrun with trolls. For years, we've battled a losing war that has drained both our money and our ability to mine resources...

Now, of all places, the city I was born in has fallen to trolls. I will not let this misfortune simply pass by like the other ones, I will fight tooth and nail to reclaim it, unless death claims me first. My family deserve that much, at least..."

Humans in our sacred burial grounds! How dare they! The tombs of our Ancestors, the ancient Heroes of Dwarfdom, who rose from the deep caves and helped us found great Empires and Nations... They treated their memory like it was nothing. The fury I felt, looking back on it, was like little I felt before. It was so powerful, so controlling... The feeling of it almost makes me fear myself.

A Dwarf has joined us, by the name of "Semas". He seems aged, but very concentrated and devoted. I am glad to have him with us, though he has shown remarkable -- and somewhat unhinged -- fighting prowess."

It didn't take long for the inhabitants of the tunnel to find their way to the breach and attack the mine. Little is remembered about the expedition inwards, or the creatures that attacked. Since the trolls captured the eastern mines, this path has seldom been taken by dwarves. Who knows what sort of foul creatures could await us. Some of the shacks used by the miners still stand, but many regard these tunnels as cursed. Priests and Nomads will occasionally come to live here for a time, but they don't stray far from the safety of the old castle."
