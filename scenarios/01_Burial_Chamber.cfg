            story= _ "Excerpt from the journal of Dulotmos of Garhme; 5,127 DE, 12 Y

I am glad to be undertaking this expedition, for I fear what has happened to my kinfolk. I have been cramped up in that castle for so long. Yes, I was doing the 'good work' but it was just bureaucracy. Regardless of how much I reassure myself, managing statistics can't distract me from the doubts that I've felt increasing in my core. Has it been good for the kingdom? Sure. But I've not seen my wife in a year, my children for a half and two! Ah, it's seems like an age since I've seen the magnificent walls, or those mushroom groves I used to tend... but 'promotions are progress', so here I am.

Anyway, the company heads out toward Marne shortly. The expedition force has been gathered in Karladam, and we will soon reach that outpost that lies just ahead, I can't for all the veins remember its name."
